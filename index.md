I am a Ph.D. student at [The Graduate Center, the City University of New York(CUNY)](https://www.gc.cuny.edu) and my advisor is [Dr. Ioannis Stamos](http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~ioannis/). I was working in Google Pittsburgh as a software engineer intern for the machine perception team during the summer of 2018. For the summer 2017, I was working as a deep learning intern at Philips North American Research and I was doing a video analysis project together with [MIT Senseable City Lab](http://senseable.mit.edu/) 

My main research interests are in machine learning, computer vision and data visualization. In particular, I am interested in supervised/semi-supervised machine learning, Convolutional/Graph Neural Networks. Also, I am interested in visualization of social media data.
