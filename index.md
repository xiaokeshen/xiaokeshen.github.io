I am a Ph.D. student at [The Graduate Center, the City University of New York(CUNY)](https://https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Computer-Science) and my advisor is [Dr. Ioannis Stamos](http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~ioannis/). I was working in Google Pittsburgh as a software engineer intern for the machine perception team during the summer of 2018 and  Philips North American Research as a Deep Learning intern during the summer of 2017.

My main research interests are in machine learning, computer vision and data visualization. In particular, I am interested in supervised/semi-supervised machine learning, Convolutional/Graph Neural Networks. Also, I am interested in visualization of social media data.
